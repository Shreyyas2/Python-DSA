'''Problem Description: You are given the speed of a vehicle and the time it has traveled. Your task is to compute and return the distance traveled by the vehicle.

Formula: To calculate the distance traveled by a vehicle:

Distance=SpeedÃ—Time


Input: Two floating-point numbers, speed and time, representing the speed of the vehicle and the time it has been traveling.


Output: A floating-point number representing the distance traveled.'''
